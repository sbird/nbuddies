# write the general conic section solution 

# the idea is that in centre of mass frame and relative coordinates (r vector = r_1 vector - r_2 vector), 
# r vector traces out a conic section. The general equation of the conic is 
#                           r(1 + e cos(phi)) = rhs
# where e is eccentricity, r is the magnitude of r vector, phi is the polar angle measured relative to the point where r becomes minimum, 
# and rhs is just some quantity that depends on G, m_1, m_2, energy and angular momentum. (cf. chapter 8 of Classical Mechanics by John R Taylor)
# We just need to verify that this equation holds at all timesteps
# For that we need to first compute the relative r and v vectors  

# the following function takes in the list of BH_objects with their final positions
# and velocities stored as attributes. If the saving is happening in batches and with 
# pickling, all the batches must be unpickled and the list 'BH_data_final' must be constructed

class AnalyticalCheck():

    (docstring to be updated)

    1) converts the positions and velocities into relative coordinates. 
    2) computes the relevant physical quantities
    3) checks if the conic equation above is satisfied at all time steps or not
    4) implicitly checks that the motion is planar as well

    NOTE: It is convenient to demand that the analytical check be run on 2 black holes with initial velocities 
          and positions lying entirely in the x-y plane. This way we can also check for the planarity of motion
          and also convert to polar coordinates easily.
